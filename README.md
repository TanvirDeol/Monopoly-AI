> Play against an AI Monopoly Player Online

### What it Does ðŸ’¡: 
- Users play against an AI monopoly player in real time.
- AI player is implemented using three levels/strategies (only one is deployed on the site)
  - Monte Carlo (main): Uses monte carlo tree search to simulate future outcomes and selects decision with highest chance of success
  - Markov Chains: Calculates probability of landing on every possible property via Markov Chain steady states and buys properties with best expected value
  - Basic Human: Probability of buying a property is a linear function of how close it is to Boardwalk, similar to how regular people play.

### How it Was Built ðŸ”Ž:
- Frontend built using Javascript/CSS/HTML, animations and designs from scratch
- Backend powered using Django, which communicates with player via REST API
